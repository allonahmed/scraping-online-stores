-web scraping is the process of gathering information from the internet usually involving automation

-keep in mind that some websites dont like when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don't mind
be sure to check terms of service

-challenges: every site is different due to so many different technologies and age of the internet. 
And even if you are successfully able to scrape a certain site... it could end up breaking the next day if
updates are made.


-challenge to note for the future: some sites may have information blocked behind a login system. And even
thought you may have authentication on the browser of that site, it is a little different trying to authenticate
through your python script. however, requests should be able to solve this issue

Static vs Dynamic sites:
Typically when dealing with static sites, we only need to acces the html content to extract the data we want,
meaning all we need to to use requests to get the site content and parse it using Beautiful Soup

With Dynamic sites, where site data comes from the server, we will typically need to extract javascript data instead.
